# DataFun-07-Applied Project Repository

## Project Purpose
This project demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning through simple linear regression, following the guided exercises in chapters 10.16 and 15.4 of "Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science: Learning to Program with AI, Big Data, and the Cloud."

## Overview
The aim is to harness simple linear regression, a supervised learning technique, to develop a model that can predict future values based on existing data. The model will be represented as a "best-fit" straight line derived from the data.

## Project Requirements
- Develop a simple linear regression model.
- Use the model for prediction purposes.
- Visualize the model's regression line.
- Share insights derived from the project.

## Project Structure & Deliverables
- **Repository Name**: `datafun-07-applied`
- **README.md**: Introduction and guidelines for the project setup and execution.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of necessary packages for running the project.
- **Example Files**: Includes textbook materials necessary for undertaking the project.
- **tmontague_ml.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the project's code.

## Environment Setup & Execution Guide
1. Initialize a GitHub repository named `datafun-07-applied`. Include a README.md for an overview.
2. Clone the repository to your local environment:
3. Setup and activate a virtual environment in `.venv`:
4. Install the required packages and capture them in `requirements.txt`:
5. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude `.vscode/` and `.venv/`.

## Project Organization
- Download project-related materials from the textbook's examples section.
- Place these materials in an `examples` subfolder within the project's repository.
- Begin your analysis with the `tmontague_ml.ipynb` notebook, ensuring to document your project adequately.

## Contribution Guidelines
We encourage contributions to improve the project. Please submit issues or pull requests for enhancements or fixes.
